I'd like to capture an Architecture Decision Record for the project described in the documents below.

Document scope:
   • Purpose: **Why** we made key design choices.  
   • Contents: problem context, chosen solution, pros/cons, alternatives, related requirement IDs.

Review these related documents for full context:

------

<project_docs>
{{.repomix-profiles/outputs/project-docs.xml}}
</project_docs>

<project_rules>
{{.repomix-profiles/outputs/cursor-rules.xml}}
</project_rules>

<implementation_plan>
{{_docs/execution/execution-plan.md}}
</implementation_plan>

<existing_code>
{{.repomix-profiles/outputs/full-codebase.xml}}
</existing_code>

Return your draft in this block:

```adr
# ADR-001
**Status:** Proposed / Accepted

## Context
(Problem or driving force)

## Decision
(Chosen solution)

## Consequences
- Pros:
- Cons:

## Alternatives Considered
1. Alternative A – reasons
2. Alternative B – reasons

## Related Requirements
- FR-01, NFR-02
```

ADR considerations:

- Define the problem space clearly, including constraints and drivers
- Quantify trade-offs where possible (performance, cost, time)
- Include operational impact of the decision
- Specify revisit criteria for decisions marked temporary
- Note stakeholders consulted during the decision process
- Link directly to specific requirements impacted by the decision
- Consider risks and mitigation strategies 

Please:

1. Ask clarifying questions about context or trade-offs.
2. Suggest any missing alternatives.
3. Ensure alignment with requirements.
4. Show the full updated block each time.
5. Flag any unresolved concerns.
